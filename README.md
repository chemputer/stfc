# stfc notes

Subject: stfc - notes and bits of info on Star Trek Fleet Command
From: Todd T. Fries <todd@fries.net>
To: anyone reading this
```

I've noted a few individuals asking for info.  Rather than repeat it
every time someone asks, I collect it here for my own use and others.

I welcome others to contribute, or corrections.  I am only human!

Enjoy!

Thanks,
